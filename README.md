## Getting Started


The app includes:

- Main page that user can select game type as single player or multiplayer.
- Single player game screen
- Multiplayer game screen


## Game Rules

The main goal is to reach to the number `1` by dividing given numbers to three. The first player that reaches the number `1` is the winner.

Initial Step: Game starts with the random number as a given number.<br>

The player should find which number `{-1, 0, +1}` should be added to the given number to make it divisible byâ€‹ three. Players cannot add the wrong number. When the number is added, the divisible number automatically divides by 3. The result is sent to the other player. Opponent applies the same rule to the given number. The same rules are applied until one player reaches the number 1 after the division.

Multiplayer game example: random number is 11.</br>
First player should choose `+1` from `{-1, 0, +1}`. Add `+1` to 11 (result 12). 12 is divided by 3 (result 4). The Second player gets number 4, add `-1` to 4 (result 3). 3 is divided by 3 (result 1).  The second player wins the game!

In the single-player game, the opponent user is the computer. <br>
In a multiplayer game, the opponent user is the real player. Maximum two players can play the game at the same time. Both players should be available to start the game.
